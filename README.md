# online-shop-microservices

I used the available Online Demo Microservices from Google (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) to practice deploying a fully fledged microservice application in Kubernetes.

I then created a helm template out of the configuration files so it could be more easily deployed, removed, or updated.
